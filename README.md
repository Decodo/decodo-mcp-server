## Running MCP server locally (manual)

<details>

<summary>Running MCP server locally</summary>

### Prerequisites:

- Node.js >= `18.0`
- An MCP client - popular choices are [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) and
  [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)

2. Clone this repo and run:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

3. Take a note of your build location:

```
cd build/
pwd
```

Adding `index.js` to the end of this directory, your build file location will look something like
this:

```
/Users/your.user/projects/decodo-mcp/build/index.js
```

4. Update your MCP client with server information:

### Claude Desktop

[Follow the guide here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) to find the setup file,
then update `claude_desktop_config.json` to look like this:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "decodo-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/your.user/projects/decodo-mcp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "SCRAPER_API_USERNAME": "your_username",
        "SCRAPER_API_PASSWORD": "your_password"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

### Cursor

See
[Cursor documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#installing-mcp-servers)
for how to install.

## Tools

The server exposes the following tools:

| Tool                   | Description                                                          | Example prompt                                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scrape`               | Scrapes any target URL, expects a URL to be given via prompt.        | Scrape peacock.com from a US ip address and tell me the pricing |
| `google_search_parsed` | Scrapes Google Search for a given query, and returns parsed results. | Scrape google search for shoes and tell me the top position     |
| `amazon_search_parsed` | Scrapes Amazon Search for a given query, and returns parsed results. | Scrape amazon for toothbrushes                                  |

## Parameters

The following parameters are inferred from user prompts:

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `jsRender`     | Renders target URL in a headless browser.                                                            |
| `geo`          | Sets the country from which request will originate.                                                  |
| `locale`       | Sets the locale of the request.                                                                      |
| `tokenLimit`   | Truncates the response content up to this limit. Useful if the context window is small.              |
| `fullResponse` | Skips automatic truncation and returns full content. If context window is small, may throw warnings. |

## Examples

### Scraping geo-restricted content

Query your AI agent with the following prompt:

```
Scrape peacock.com from a German ip address and tell me the pricing
```

This prompt will say that peacock.com is geo-restricted. To come around the geo-restriction:

```
Scrape peacock.com from a US ip address and tell me the pricing
```

### Limiting number of response tokens

If your agent has a small context window, the content returned from scraping will be automatically
truncated, in order to avoid context-overflow. You can increase the number of tokens returned:

```
Scrape hacker news, return 50k tokens
```

If your agent has a big context window, tell it to return `full content`:

```
Scrape hacker news, return full content
```
